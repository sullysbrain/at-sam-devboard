Note:

"No device found on cu.usbmodem####" error

This issue has been most noticeable on Macs. After resetting the board into the bootloader, the delay before attempting an upload isn't long enough. After the first upload try, you should see the yellow "RX" LED illuminate â€“ usually indicating the board has reset into bootloader mode. Another upload try should take.

Until solved, you may have to deal with either double-upload-clicking, or resetting the board into bootloader before uploading.
